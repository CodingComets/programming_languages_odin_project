		<h1>Common Programming Languages</h1>
		
		<p>A programming language is a system of notation for <em>writing computer programs.</em>
		Programming languages are described in terms of their syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), 
		usually defined by a formal language. 
		Languages usually provide features such as a type system, variables, and mechanisms 
		for error handling. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language" target = "_blank">link</a></p>
