		<div class = "box-one">
			<p>A programming language is a system of notation for <em>writing computer programs.</em>
			Programming languages are described in terms of their syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), 
			usually defined by a formal language. 
			Languages usually provide features such as a type system, variables, and mechanisms 
			for error handling. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language" target = "_blank">link</a></p>

		<div class = "box-two">
			<p>Languages usually provide features such as a type system, variables, and mechanisms for 
			error handling. An implementation of a programming language is required in order to execute programs, 
			namely an interpreter or a compiler.</p>
